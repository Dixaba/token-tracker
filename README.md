Simple token tracker for League events.

Just open the page, enter start and end dates, the desired amount of tokens to earn and that's it!

When you earn some - just enter the amount and press "Add".  

Every time you open it, you'll see how successfully you manage to earn them, how much time left and how many games you need to play (on average).

Written in C++ \ Qt, build into WebAssembly.
